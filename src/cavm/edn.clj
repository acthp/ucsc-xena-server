; Assume that jdbc blobs are htfc & allow printing.
;
; Normally we wouldn't extend a 3rd-party class like this, but
; since we aren't delivering a library it doesn't really matter.
; The alternative is to find a way to automatically wrap the blobs
; as they come from h2, e.g. with a tree walk, or evaluating the
; sql on the way in to determine which return values will be
; htfc.
